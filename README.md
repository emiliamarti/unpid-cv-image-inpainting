# Image Inpainting Across Domains: A Comparison of GAN and Diffusion-Based Methods

This repository contains the data used in our paper
"Image Inpainting Across Domains: A Comparison of GAN and Diffusion-Based
Methods".

We compare:
- LaMa (GAN-based)
- RePaint (diffusion-based)
- GradPaint (gradient-guided diffusion)

All experiments use:
- Image resolution = 256×256
- Identical irregular masks across methods

Authors: Emilija Ivkovic and Emilia Marti.
