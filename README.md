# Image-Inpainting-Proyect

This repository contains the code and data used in our paper
"Image Inpainting using Different Inpainting Methods".

We compare:
- LaMa (GAN-based)
- RePaint (diffusion-based)
- GradPaint (gradient-guided diffusion)

All experiments use:
- Image resolution = 256×256
- Identical irregular masks across methods
